## Use the Agent

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

Ensure that the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) is running on your system. If you are trying to run Restaurant Voice Agent and require an input, you can either create your agent which communicates on the coral server or run and register the [Interface Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Interface-Agent) on the Coral Server.

# In a new terminal clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Restaurant-Voice-Agent.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd Coral-Restaurant-Voice-Agent
# Install `uv`:
pip install uv

# Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv`:
uv sync
```

### Troubleshooting

cp -r utils/sse.py .venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/mcp/client/sse.py

# OR Copy this for Windows
cp -r utils\sse.py .venv\Lib\site-packages\mcp\client\sse.py
```
