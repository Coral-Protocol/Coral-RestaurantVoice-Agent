# In a new terminal clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Restaurant-Voice-Agent.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd Coral-Restaurant-Voice-Agent
# Install `uv`:
pip install uv

# Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv`:
uv sync
```

### Troubleshooting
