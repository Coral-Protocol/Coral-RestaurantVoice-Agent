## Use the Agent

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies

Ensure that the [Coral Server](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/coral-server) is running on your system. If you are trying to run Restaurant Voice Agent and require an input, you can either create your agent which communicates on the coral server or run and register the [Interface Agent](https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Coral-Interface-Agent) on the Coral Server.

```bash
# In a new terminal clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Restuarant-Voice-Agent.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd Restuarant-Voice-Agent
# Install `uv`:
pip install uv

# Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml` using `uv`:
uv sync
```

## Agent System

### üè™ Greeter Agent
Welcomes customers, presents menu (Pizza $10, Salad $5, Ice Cream $3, Coffee $2), and routes to specialized agents.

### üìÖ Reservation Agent
Handles dining reservations - collects time, customer name, and phone number.

### ü•° Takeaway Agent

## Usage Examples

<details>

**Getting Started:**
1. Start the agent using `uv run python main.py console`
2. The Greeter Agent will automatically welcome you to the restaurant
3. Say "Hi!" or any greeting to initiate the conversation
4. The agent will then listen to other agent calling it (for example interface agent)
5. Continue your conversation naturally - the system will route you to the appropriate specialized agent

**Making a Reservation:**

# Medical Office Triage Voice Agent

The Medical Office Triage Voice Agent is an intelligent multi-agent voice system that automates patient routing and support in medical office environments. It uses real-time voice processing to understand patient needs and seamlessly transfers them between specialized departments (Triage, Support, and Billing) while maintaining conversation context. The system leverages Deepgram for speech-to-text, Cartesia for text-to-speech, OpenAI for natural language understanding, and LiveKit for real-time communication with noise cancellation capabilities.

## Responsibility
A real-time voice agent for medical offices that automates patient intake, support, and billing routing. **Note:** The prompts in this agent are not for a multi-agent system; it currently works as a standalone agent, does not require interface agents, but will use Coral tools. It is not continuously using the `wait_for_mention` tool to receive commands from other agents.

## Details
- **Framework:** LiveKit Agents
- **Tools Used:** Deepgram STT, Cartesia TTS, OpenAI LLM, Silero VAD, LiveKit Plugins
- **AI Model:** GPT-4o-mini
